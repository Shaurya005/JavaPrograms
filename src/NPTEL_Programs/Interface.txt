Now there are two things in Java which makes the Java programming a unique is a package and interface. And this is why the Java programming is basically more popular compared to the other programming languages in particular to build very large and complex software.


As we see these are the two methods are the implementation of the method abstract method which is there.So, whenever some abstract methods are there in abstract class it is a responsibility ofthe programmer to implement it fully.If you do not implement then you will not be able to create any object of this class that we have created just now



Now, whenever i equals to 0 this area will bind to the circle objects whenever i equalsto 1 this area will bind into the rectangular object, whenever i equal to 2 this area will bind to the ellipse object.So, geo Objects i and it is just automatically binding with a corresponding object this isan example is called dynamic binding or it is also called run time polymorphism. Because this geometric object polymorphically works for any area irrespective of the typeof the object it is.Now, this is one very good example of usage of the abstract class so we have used earlier.Now like this type of concept we are now going to discuss other things. So fine, this we can see from the geometry object we have to derive three classes, butthis derives by means of single inheritance. (Refer to Slide Time: 10:43)But in some situations you know we have to have the concept of multiple inheritance.Now how this concept is there now regarding abstract class and everything as we have discussedthis thing that those things are already discussed.So, I do not want to repeat it fine.So, the abstract method is automatically abstract itself, and then if a class may be declaredas an abstract even if it has no abstract method also this prevents it from being instantiated.


you will learn about that interface an abstractclass is in many ways very similar is very difficult to find a difference between thetwo.But the difference is that abstract class allows only single inheritance whereas, theinterface which is very similar to an abstract class, but it supports inheritance multipleinheritances.So, this is the key difference between the abstract class and then interface in Java


As I told you so an interface is basically very similar to a class it is very similarto an abstract class more specifically.This means that like classes an interface can contain members and methods.However, the difference between the class and interface is that in case of interfaceall members are final and all methods are abstract.There should not be any members which are nonfinal and any method which is non abstract.Now, this is the difference between the class and then interface whereas, if you see theclass abstract class and then interface as you have already learned that the membershipwill be final.And then inter abstract even can container abstract method as well known abstract method.This is also on the difference between the abstract class and interface concept and anotherthing is that for both abstract class and interface no object can be instantiated.So, this is a similar this thing we in that sense there are two things are similar.


Now, as we see so what is the usage of abstract class or interface if you cannot instantiatean object, if you do not build an object of that class what is the use of it.Actually, all abstract class or an interface in Java basically gives a template for a class.A framework for a class: so it basically gives a profile or a view that; how a class thatyou should have if you want to create your own program; if you follow the concept accordingto the abstract class and interface.So, abstract class and interface give a concept rather it gives a protocol of behavior thatshould be implemented by your Java programs that you want to develop it.So, it gives basically the rule of thumb about creating your own class taking the rule fromthe abstract class or interface this is the concept.And as I have already told you an interface defines a set of methods but does not implementthem, because they are declared as an abstract it is just like an abstract class also.And a class should implement that methods which is declared theirs as an abstract methodin an interface.That means, the interface is a structure, and then if you want to create a class withsupport of interface then it is a responsibility of that class to implement.That means, clearly defined all the method that if there in that sense.And as you have already told you all methods those are there in an interface they shouldbe declared as a public and abstract.And by default, if you do not declare any access specification then it will be consideredas a public and abstract.And otherwise so it is a thing and then static methods cannot be declared in an interface.So, that is one important restriction so far the thing is a concern there in.But however, in the abstract class also you can declare a static method as well as.Anyway so interface it is like this all methods will be abstract more clearly all interfacewill be public and abstract and no static method should be declared there.However, members are a concern they should be declared a public final and also static.So, these are the thing that is equal so for the interface is concerns are there.Now, how an interface can be created.


 no variable should be declared with the same name as that is there in theinterface there. So, the method should be in fact, because it is a static and publicdeclared in the interface. So, we cannot redeclare or redefine the same variable name or membersin the class implementation ok
 
 you can see one thing that NestedIf we have expansion A .(dot),there is a special location specification that A .(dot), means it is the interface whichis declaring the class A. If you do not do in this case it will work,but in some situations if inside A class there more than interface then better to do it likethis one. So, otherwise if some interface already in the same name appears somewhereelse then it can give a what is called the ambiguity. So, in order to resolve this wehave to explicitly mention that this interface belongs to which class. So, that is why thespecific location mention that is A .
