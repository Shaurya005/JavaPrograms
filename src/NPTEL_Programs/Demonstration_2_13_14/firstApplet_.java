//	//Writing both java and html file in two different files is avoided rather we save all the thing in the same file.
//    //Running this applet where this code isn't embedded in any HTML file, type appletviewer firstApplet_.java in cmd
//}//Both Java and Applet viewer are runtime interpreter, java program interpret the byte code which is in class file and then applet viewer is interpreting the code by ignoring all code except those are with HTML tag.

////Here both firstApplet_ and firstApplet_.class are fine\
////It works same if // is used in each line instead of /* for whole block.
