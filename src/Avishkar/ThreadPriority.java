//Setting priority to threads. There are three priority viz. min, max, and normal
/*
To set a threadâ€™s priority, use the setPriority( ) method, which is a member of Thread. Its general form is:

final void setPriority(int level)

Here, level specifies the new priority setting for the calling thread. The value of level must be within the range MIN_PRIORITY and MAX_PRIORITY,
Currently, these values are 1 and 10, respectively. To return a thread to default priority, specify NORM_PRIORITY, which is currently 5.
These priorities are defined as static final variables within Thread. You can obtain the current priority setting by calling the getPriority( ) method of Thread,

final int getPriority(
